# FINANCE-APP-BACKEND

The powerful and secure backend service for the FINANCE-APP, built with Node.js and Express.

## ✨ About the Project

This repository contains the backend codebase for the FINANCE-APP, a robust server-side application built on Node.js and Express. It serves as the central API and business logic layer for the entire financial management platform. The backend is responsible for handling all core functionalities, including user authentication, data processing, database interactions, and secure communication with the frontend client.

The architecture is designed following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and making the application scalable and maintainable. It handles everything from defining the database schemas (`models`) and managing the application's business logic (`controllers`) to exposing secure API endpoints (`routes`). The backend also integrates with external services for tasks like sending emails (`mailer.js`), scheduling reminders (`cron.js`), and managing file uploads (`multer.js`, `cloudinary.js`), providing a full-featured and reliable foundation for the FINANCE-APP.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Implements JWT-based authentication to protect routes and user data (`authMiddleware.js`).
*   **👤 Complete User Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users (`userController.js`, `deleteUsers.js`).
*   **💳 Transaction & Payment Processing:** Logic for handling, scheduling, and recording payments and transactions (`transactionController.js`, `schedulePayment.js`).
*   **📧 Automated Email Services:** Integrated mailer for sending reminders and user invitations (`reminderMailer.js`, `inviteUser.js`).
*   **🕒 Scheduled Tasks:** Utilizes cron jobs for automated tasks like sending payment reminders (`cron.js`).
*   **🖼️ Cloud-Based Image Uploads:** Manages file uploads by integrating with Cloudinary for efficient storage (`cloudinary.js`, `multer.js`).
*   **🔀 RESTful API Design:** A well-structured API with clear and consistent endpoints for all frontend interactions.

## 📂 Project Structure

The backend is organized into a modular structure that separates responsibilities, making it easy to navigate and extend:

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The backend leverages a powerful and widely-used set of technologies to ensure performance and reliability:

*   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable server-side applications.
*   **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
*   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing application data, interacted with via Mongoose.
*   **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, managing relationships between data and providing schema validation.
*   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Used for creating access tokens to secure the API.
*   **Cloudinary & Multer:** For handling image and file uploads efficiently.

## 🖥️ API Endpoints

The backend exposes a collection of RESTful API endpoints that the frontend application consumes. These routes are organized by feature and handle all data interactions. Key route groups include:

*   `/api/users`: For user registration, login, and profile management.
*   `/api/admin`: For administrative actions like viewing and managing users.
*   `/api/transactions`: For creating and fetching financial transactions.
*   `/api/payments`: For scheduling and confirming payments.

Each endpoint is protected by appropriate middleware to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access the resources.
